        I am working on research titled Social Engineering Prevention for Young Populations A Multimodal Fusion Detection Approach.
        In this role I have conducted literature reviews in the  domains of social media phishing, multimodal classification, and
        fusion models. I have also collected over 60,000 records from various social media sites via web scraping. I built a 
        database of 8,000 records with 90% being not phishing occurences and 10% being phishing occurences from social media posts 
        that contain both text and an image. I am now working on running the dataset through various fusion models.
